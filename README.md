## 👋 **Greeting**

Dear Team,

Dear Mykola Povshednyi Dmytro Povarchuk Denys Shkramko Andrii Bereznyi

I hope everything is going well =))

If that's the case, I'd like to share with you a unique chance to take part in a practical challenge.

## 🎯 **Project Background**

A bit of background: we have a project focused on **SBOM generation, validation, and consumption workflows**. Within this project, there is an opportunity that may later grow into a long-term position.

---

## 📋 **Challenge Requirements**

To join, you need to complete one small task:

### **1. JSON Schema Design**
Create a JSON schema that incorporates multiple nested objects with varying levels of complexity. The schema should include a mix of mandatory and optional fields, allowing for flexibility in structure while enforcing certain required elements.

### **2. JSON Examples Generation**
Generate three JSON examples based on this schema. Two of these should be valid, demonstrating different combinations of optional fields, which highlights the schema's adaptability. The third JSON should deliberately fail validation, though it should appear valid at first glance, introducing an intentional subtle error.

### **3. Python Program Development**
Develop a Python program to process the three JSONs. First, the program should validate each JSON against the schema, identifying whether it's valid or invalid and providing feedback on the results. For the two valid JSONs, the program should analyze their properties, including all nested elements, and compute a similarity coefficient to quantify their structural and data-related similarity. The logic for calculating the coefficient is open-ended but should take into account both the presence and values of properties.
